# Unit I: Introduction to Linux

## 1. Linux: History and Introduction

**Overview**
Operating systems are used everywhere in the world today. An operating system is needed for every computer, from a smartphone to a supercomputer. Linux is an operating system used a lot in many different places, like servers, embedded systems, personal computers, and mobile devices.

**Introduction**

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like free operating system kernel initially developed by Linus Torvalds, who studied computer science at the University of Helsinki in 1991, developed it as a side project. It has since grown into a full-fledged operating system with a vast and active community of developers and users. This section will delve into the history and introduction of Linux.

Linux is an operating system known for its open-source nature, security, and stability. Here are some key characteristics:

- **Open Source**: Linux is distributed under open-source licenses, meaning that its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This fosters collaboration and innovation.

- **Kernel**: The Linux kernel is at the core of the operating system. It manages hardware resources, multitasking, and user interactions.

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Linux offers a powerful command-line interface, which allows users to interact with the system efficiently through text commands. This is particularly useful for automation and remote administration.

- **Multi-User and Multi-Tasking**: Linux is designed to support multiple users concurrently and allows multiple processes to run simultaneously, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

- **Security**: Linux is known for its robust security features. It employs user and group permissions, firewalls, and regular security updates to protect against vulnerabilities.

- **Stability**: Linux systems are known for their stability and reliability. They can run for extended periods without needing to be rebooted.

## History of Linux

The Linux operating system is based on Unix. So before we learn the history of Linux, we need to know about Unix. In the 1960s, a group of programmers led by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created Unix at Bell Labs. Unix was an operating system that was initially made for powerful mainframe computers. Later on, it was modified so smaller computers could also run it.

**Evolution of Unix**
In the 1980s, several operating systems similar to Unix were made. These systems tried to copy Unix's features while being affordable and easier to use. These included Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), Xenix, and GNU (GNU's Not Unix). Based on the Unix kernel, these operating systems were made more modular and flexible using open-source code.

**Expansion of Unix**
During the 1970s and 1980s, Unix became more prominent in academic and scientific circles. The availability of source code allowed customization and the development of individual flavors.

In the 1980s, businesses like Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM made commercial versions of Unix that were tailored for specific hardware platforms and had more features. Unix's growth in history was further helped by Linux, a free and open-source operating system based on Unix.

MacOS, Apple's desktop operating system, is based on Unix and shares many of its key features. It was another big step forward for Unix. Unix is still one of the most important developments in the world of computing, and its continued development and growth will continue to shape the industry for many years to come.

**Why was Linux Created?**
Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student, invented Linux, an open-source operating system that became popular in 1991. Torvalds didn't like the limitations in the operating systems available then, so he set out to develop one that was free and open source.

The aim behind Linux was to make an operating system that anybody could use and modify as they wanted. Torvalds released the initial version of Linux under the GNU General Public License, which let users use, modify, and share the software as long as they make their modifications available under the same license.

Due to its dependability, versatility, and growth potential, Linux is now a popular choice for servers, supercomputers, and embedded devices. It has also created a lively community of developers who keep adding to its growth and development.

**Evolution of Linux**
The open-source operating system Linux has greatly changed since it was first built. Early versions of Linux were primarily controlled by the command line and didn't have the easy-to-use graphical interfaces that other operating systems had. But because the system was flexible, reliable, and safe, many developers started building graphical interfaces and a wide range of software applications.

Linux has become more popular as businesses and organizations have started to use it and as cloud computing has become more widespread. It has become a flexible and extensively used operating system that can run on everything from small embedded devices to high-performance supercomputers. It has changed through time because of the community of developers and users who continue to work on it and help it grow.

## Features or Linux (What Made it So Popular?)

The reason why Linux became so popular is because of its inbuilt natural features. Let's learn all the natural features.

**Customizable**: Users can modify and customize the system to meet their specific needs.

**Stability**: Linux is regarded as stable and reliable, making it a popular choice for servers and other systems that need to work well all the time.

**Security**: Viruses and malware are less likely to affect Linux than other operating systems, making it a safe choice for businesses and individuals.

**Flexibility**: Linux can be modified to run on various hardware platforms, from small embedded devices to supercomputers.

**Open-source**: The source code is available to everyone, which allows for transparency and encourages the community to help with its development and expansion.

**Cost-effective**: Linux is generally free, or it can be called affordable, making it a good choice for individuals and businesses.

Overall, Linux's qualities have helped it become famous and successful and made it an excellent alternative to operating systems that are not affordable.

Conclusion
The history of Linux starts with the development of Unix at Bell Labs in the 1960s.
