**Use Case: Log Analysis with Pipeline**

Suppose you have a large log file from a web server, and you want to analyze the number of times each unique IP address has accessed your website. You can use a pipeline of Linux utilities to achieve this:

suppose you have a log file called access.log with the following contents:

```bash
192.168.1.100 - - [12/Mar/2023:15:45:23 +0000] "GET /page1.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1234
192.168.1.101 - - [12/Mar/2023:15:46:01 +0000] "GET /page2.html HTTP/1.1" 404 5678
192.168.1.102 - - [12/Mar/2023:15:46:05 +0000] "GET /page1.html HTTP/1.1" 200 9876
192.168.1.100 - - [12/Mar/2023:15:47:30 +0000] "GET /page3.html HTTP/1.1" 200 3456
192.168.1.101 - - [12/Mar/2023:15:47:45 +0000] "GET /page4.html HTTP/1.1" 200 7890
192.168.1.102 - - [12/Mar/2023:15:48:10 +0000] "GET /page3.html HTTP/1.1" 404 1234
```

1. **cat**: Display the contents of the log file.
   ```bash
   cat access.log
   ```

2. **grep**: 
- Filter lines containing IP addresses.
   ```bash
   cat access.log | grep -oE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b"
   ```
- The `grep` command with the `-oE` option searches for IP addresses in the log file using a regular expression.The regular expression `\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b` is used to match and extract IP addresses from a text document. Let's break down what each part of the regular expression:

- `\b`: This is a word boundary anchor. It matches the position where a word (sequence of alphanumeric characters) starts or ends. In this context, it ensures that we match complete IP addresses and not parts of them within other words.

- `([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}`: This part of the regular expression matches the first three octets of the IP address, separated by periods (`.`). Let's break it down further:
  - `[0-9]{1,3}`: This part matches one to three digits (0-9). It specifies that an octet can consist of one to three numeric digits.
  - `\.`: This matches a literal period character, which separates octets in an IP address.
  - `(...){3}`: This whole group is enclosed in parentheses and followed by `{3}`, which means it should match exactly three occurrences of the preceding group. This ensures that we capture the first three octets.

- `[0-9]{1,3}`: This part matches the fourth octet of the IP address, which is also one to three digits, just like the previous octets.

- `\b`: Similar to the first `\b`, this is another word boundary anchor. It ensures that we match complete IP addresses and not partial ones within other words.

So, when you put it all together, `\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b` is a regular expression that matches and extracts complete IP addresses from a text document. It assumes that IP addresses are written in a standard format with four octets separated by periods and ensures that it matches only complete IP addresses, not partial ones within larger words.

3. **sort**: Sort the IP addresses to group identical ones together.
   ```bash
   cat access.log | grep -oE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b" | sort
   ```

4. **uniq -c**: Count the occurrences of each unique IP address.
   ```bash
   cat access.log | grep -oE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b" | sort | uniq -c
   ```

   - The `uniq -c` command counts and displays the occurrences of each unique line.

5. **sort -n**: Sort the IP addresses by the count in ascending order.
   ```bash
   cat access.log | grep -oE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b" | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
   ```
   output:
```bash
    1 192.168.1.100
    1 192.168.1.101
    2 192.168.1.102
```

   - This step is optional, but it can be useful to see the IP addresses with the highest access counts at the end.




<!-- 

- `\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){4}\b`: This regular expression matches any sequence of four octets separated by periods but does not impose specific constraints on the numeric values in each octet. It will match any sequence of four numbers separated by periods, even if some of the numbers are outside the valid range for IP octets. So, your example `1.1.1.111111` would be considered a valid match by this regex because it only checks for the format of four octets separated by periods.

- `\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b`: This regular expression also matches sequences of four octets separated by periods but ensures that the first three octets are one to three digits each, followed by a period, and the fourth octet is also one to three digits. It specifically matches valid IPv4 addresses. Your example `1.1.1.11111` would not be considered valid by this regex because it checks for the specific format of an IPv4 address.
