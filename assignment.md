### Q5: Matching IP Address Pairs with Roll Number

Write a script to find out your IP address, remove dots (.), make pairs of 2 digits serially, and check if your roll number matches any of the pairs of IP addresses. If the roll number is less than 10, multiply it by 10. 
For example, if your IP address is `192.167.1.1` then the pairs will be `19`, `21`, `67`, `11`. If your roll number is 5, then multiply it by 10, i.e., 50. Now, check if 50 matches any of the pairs. If it matches, print "Found", otherwise print "Not Found".
