**Note:** This is a basic demonstration for educational purposes. In a real network environment, DHCP servers typically serve multiple clients on a network.

1. **Install DHCP Server:**
   First, you'll need to install a DHCP server package if it's not already installed on your Linux system. 

3. **Start the DHCP Server:**
   Before you work with client make sure your DHCP server is running. To start the DHCP server service use the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start isc-dhcp-server
   ```

4. **Configure a DHCP Client:**
Configure a network interface to use DHCP:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
   ```

   Edit the file to look like this (assuming the interface is named "eth0"):

   ```bash
   auto eth0
   iface eth0 inet dhcp
   ```
   Save the file and exit the text editor.

5. **Restart the Network Service:**
   To apply the DHCP configuration changes, restart the network service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart networking
   ```

6. **Monitor DHCP Server Logs:**
   You can monitor the DHCP server logs to see lease assignments and client interactions. Use the following command to view the DHCP server logs in real-time:

   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep dhcpd
   ```

7. **Request an IP Address:**
   You can manually trigger your Linux machine to request an IP address from the DHCP server by renewing its DHCP lease:

   ```bash
   sudo dhclient -r  # Release the current lease
   sudo dhclient    # Request a new lease
   ```

   Check the logs to see the DHCP lease assignment.
